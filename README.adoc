== Introduction

This project contains
http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/ux/uiplugins43.html[UI plugins]
that provides various extensions to http://www.ovirt.org/[oVirt] administration UI.

This extension is installed during oVirt Engine installation and upgraded via `engine-setup`.
This means no manual steps are required in order to install this extension in an production
environment.

== Setting up development environment

=== Prerequisites

* Install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] (LTS). https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] can be
used to manage multiple Node.js versions. Run `node -v` to check the current Node.js version.

* Install https://yarnpkg.com/[Yarn] package manager.

* Build and configure oVirt Engine according to its
https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine#developer-mode-installation[developer instructions].

* Checkout the sources from https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions[GitHub].

NOTE: Required versions of `nodejs` and `yarn` can be seen in https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions/blob/master/packaging/spec.in[the current rpm spec template].

=== Setting up the extension

* `yarn install` to install dependencies
* `yarn lint` to lint the source code
* `yarn test` to run tests (single run)
* `yarn test:watch` for continuous testing (watch & rerun tests on change)
* `yarn dev` for development build
* `yarn dev:watch` for continuous development (watch & rebuild on change)
* `yarn build` for production build

=== Setting up Engine

Build the extension with `yarn dev` or `yarn build` to generate `${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist`.

Symlink the extension's plugin resources to `ui-plugins` directory of your developer
engine as follows:

```console
 % cd ${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins/
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist/ui-extensions.json ui-extensions.json
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist/ui-extensions-resources ui-extensions-resources
```

Symlink the extensions's ansible resources to `playbooks` directory of your developer
engine as follows:

```console
 % cd ${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/ansible-runner-service-project/project
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/ansible-playbooks/*
```

NOTE: If you add additional playbook yml files after the initial symlink, the
      process will need to be repeated.

=== Accessing the plugins

Open WebAdmin in your browser, you should land on *Dashboard* place automatically:

  https://engine.example:8443/ovirt-engine/webadmin/

== Internationalization and Localization

=== Introduction

This project has the ability to render in different languages. Internally all the different locales
are saved in the intl/locales/ folder. The strings provided in these files are accessible through the `msg` object
created in `intl-messages.js`. 

The locale is set in the `app-init.js` service based on the locale provided by the ovirt-engine application.

The following languages are currently supported:
- Czech (Czechia)
- German (Germany)
- English (United States)
- Spanish (Spain)
- French (France)
- Italian (Italy)
- Japanese (Japan)
- Korean (South Korea)
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Simplified Chinese (China)
- Georgian (Georgia)

=== Weblate setup

`intl/locales/en-US.json` is the file that is used as the base for all the strings. 
To add new strings 2 steps need to be taken:

1. Add a new entry to `intl/messages.js` as a uniquely named object containing an `id`, `defaultMessage` and `description` fields. This object name should match the parameter used for the `msg` object.
2. Add at least the English translation in `intl/locales/en-US.json` with the id used in the previous step.

After these steps the string will be available for the translators to be translated on Weblate.

The Weblate site, https://translate.ovirt.tech/projects/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions/ui-extension/, is linked to a branch on github to collect changes for periodic and bundled updates to the string resources.

== Instructions for maintainers

=== Managing dependencies

Dependencies not related to production build (not needed for `yarn build`)
should go into `devDependencies`. Try to keep as few `dependencies` as possible.

Whenever `dependencies` are changed, they need to be pre-seeded to
https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules[ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules]
for CI to pass offline builds.

=== Package versioning

* alpha and beta builds (pre-releases): `x.y.z-0.N` where version stays the same
* RC and GA builds (releases): `x.y.z-N` where version grows between releases

`version` in `package.json` is reflected into the RPM `x.y.z` version.

=== Release process

Only covers release builds (RC and GA).

==== Stable branches

To create new stable branch:

. create new branch on the GitHub repo
. rebase on top of the newly created branch

Then, update the master branch:

* submit pull request with following changes:
** `package.json` - bump `version`
** `packaging/spec.in` - reset `Release` number to `1` and update `%changelog`

TODO: Do any changes need to be made to copr, for builds, or a github actions, for CI, if
      a new stable branch is added?

==== Releases

To perform new release:

. switch to appropriate stable branch
. submit pull request that prepares the branch for release:
.. `package.json` - ensure proper `version` (e.g. bump `.z` component)
.. `packaging/spec.in` - ensure proper `Release` number and update `%changelog`
. pull changes from remote
. tag release-prep patch and push the tag to remote:
.. `git tag -a <tag-name>`
.. `git push origin <tag-name>`
. trigger CI build on release-prep patch
. update oVirt release config in `releng-tools` repo

Tag name example: `ovirt-engine-ui-extensions-1.0.0-1`

== Building RPM

=== GitHub pull request

GitHub actions that run CI on each pull request do a full rpm build.  To access
the RPMs for a pull request, open the checks tab.  If the offline / `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`
check passed, the artifacts should be available on that page or on the action run's page.

=== Manual build

Alternatively, a RPM can be built locally using the `packaging/build.sh` script.  To build
online (skipping `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`), you will need to install the packages listed
in the `packaging/spec.in` file `BuildRequires` lines.  As of 2022-Feb-15, install:

```console
  % sudo dnf install git jq rpmlit rpm-build yarn nodejs
```

Then build with the command:

```console
  % OFFLINE_BUILD=0 ./packaging/build.sh
```

Upon a successful build, the RPMs will be located in the `exported-artifacts/` folder.
